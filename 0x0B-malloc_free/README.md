# 0x0B. malloc, free

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. The goal is to create a function that dynamically allocates memory for an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.

## Files

- **main.h**: Header file containing the prototype for the `create_array` function.
- **0-create_array.c**: Implementation of the `create_array` function.
- **0-main.c**: Test file for the `create_array` function.

## Function Prototype

```c
char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);
